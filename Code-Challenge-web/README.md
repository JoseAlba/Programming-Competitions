# Code-Challenge-WEB
This is the code challenge for anyone interested in being an entry level Web Developer at Igloo.

## Background
You are a new web developer working closely with the design team on a customer implementation. You receive design mock-ups, in PSD and PNG format, that have been approved by a client. Your job is to reproduce as closely as possible the contents of the design mock-up as a fully functional web site.

## Instructions
* Clone this repo to your local development environment
* Refer to the design mock-ups while developing the community home page [Design Assets](https://github.com/IglooSoftware/Code-Challenge-WEB/tree/master/assets)

## Prerequisites
To complete this challenge you will require the following:
* A modern IDE for web
* Photoshop or Photoshop alternative

## Tasks
Use the technology that you see fit to develop a new community page that looks as close as possible to the design mock-up.

Attention to detail is important (*container sizes, positioning, and fonts*)

Bonus points for adding Javascript enhancement (*Feel free to use your imagination and show off your skills with whatever frameworks you are comfortable with. We use jQuery in our platform currently.*)

## Submission
When you complete the challenge, compress your project directory and submit the archive to [implementation@igloosoftware.com](mailto:implementation@igloosoftware.com) with a subject line of **RE: Code Challenge WEB**. If the archive is too large to send via email, please store it in "the cloud," making sure that it is publicly available, and instructions to retrieve it have been provided.
